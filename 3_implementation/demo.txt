In this game we have 2 players i.e, user and computer
In this game each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes. 
Either stone or paper or scissor. 
The winner of the game is determined based on the below rules. 

Rules: 
• Rock vs Paper -> Paper wins. 
• Rock vs Scissor -> Rock wins. 
• Paper vs Scissor -> Scissor wins. 

This code asks the user to enter  0,1 or 2. 
Each number stands for a different item; Rock, Paper, or Scissors. 

The code has a random function in it that randomly generates 0,1,2. The random function generates an answer for the computer. 
Then if statements determine who wins the round. The if statements keep track of the score. 

Every time the player gets a point the Player score increases by 1 and every time the computer gets a point the computer score increases by one. The whole system is contained within a for loop. 
The loop runs the program five times. 

After it runs the code five times another set of if statements determine who won based on the score that was kept during the for loop. If it's a draw the else statement will print "No winner it's a draw!".
